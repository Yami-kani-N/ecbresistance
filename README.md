# ECB resistance project
Data suggest that the ABCC2 gene is linked to resistance in cry protein (Bt proteins).  In this project, I will focus on analyzing the differences between the ABCC2 gene in different lepidopteran insects. I will use RNA sequences of the gene and use Blast and alignment programs to look at the genomic differences between differences in different lepidopteran species in regard to the ABCC2 gene.

Secondaly, I will also explore code commands to run and calculate genotype frequencies in populations that I have been working on in my thesis. 

# Project Plan 

- This will be done by using VSCode and R. VSCode will be used to write script that will be run in R using the following steps.
- **Environment Setup-** Install R and relevant bioinformatics packages, along with VSCode and R extensions to run the codes.
- **Script Writing-** I will use VSCode to write R scripts for RNA assembly and comparison, using packages like Biostrings for sequence manipulation.
- **Assembly-** Write code to handle RNA sequences, including reading FASTA/FASTQ files, quality control, trimming adapters, and assembly. 
- **Comparison-** Implement scripts for comparing RNA sequences, utilizing bioinformatics packages for sequence alignment, identity/similarity calculation, and phylogenetic analysis.
- **Debugging and Testing-** Using VSCode's debugging capabilities and R testing frameworks to make sure scripts are correct.
- **Result Visualization-** Generate plots and visual representations of assembled RNA sequences and comparison results using R packages like ggplot2.
- **Analysis-**  Run scripts within VSCode to analyze RNA data, view output files, and interpret results.
- **Documentation and Sharing-** Document R code with comments and roxygen2-style documentation, and share it with collaborators through Git.
-Finally will run codes to run genotype frequencies on the other data set and get diagrams and graphics showing genotype frequency. 


In the project plan, I discuss using R to plot out visuals for the project because I am not sure at this point if I can get graphics and visuals for the project on VSCode using commads.

This project will help me prepare for my future projects where I will study the ABCC2 gene specifically in European corn borer. Also, the project will help me practice and get comfortable with coding techniques and languages.
